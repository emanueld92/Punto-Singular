              All these principles and design patterns are focused on maintaining a series of good practices during the development process as well as with a clean code, which allow us to keep it simple, whenever we are tempted to implement complex solutions we must ask ourselves the question, how can I implement This solution in a simpler way ?, Maintaining these good practices will help us the process of developing agile solutions and allows the integration of work teams thus enhancing the development of the proposed solution, remember Keep it simply Stupid, dry and capable
